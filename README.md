# Work-Day-Scheduler

Live deployment- https://krbex.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/

This project contains a daily calendar with color coded time blocks that reflect the hour of the day. This project will store user data in local storage and repopulate it upon next load. Localhost appears to work on my machine however the pages website would run an error I was unsure how to fix and out of time to troubleshoot.

The project was more difficult than it appeared and will require more input when I have time to add it.
